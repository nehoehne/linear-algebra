# linear-algebra 
A basic library of objects and methods that implement linear algebra concepts such as matrices, basic matrix operations, and solving systems of equations. 
# Usage 
For the time being you can just download the classes and use them as a library. I have included a couple tests to demonstrate how to use the methods. 
# What I Learned
* To implement object-oriented concepts that I learned in class
* To break a problem into smaller, easier parts
